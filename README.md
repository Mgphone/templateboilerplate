Certainly! Here's how you can structure your README.md file to guide users through the process of using your Docker setup:

# My Project

This project utilizes Docker to manage development and deployment environments. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running on your machine.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mgphone/templateboilerplate.git
```
````

### 2. Build Docker Images

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repository
```

Build the Docker images using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

### 3. Start Docker Containers

Once the images are built, you can start the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The `-d` flag runs the containers in detached mode, meaning they will continue to run in the background.

### 4. Access Your Application

Your application should now be running. You can access it in your web browser:

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:9000

## Stopping the Application

To stop the Docker containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove the containers, but retain the images and volumes.

```

Feel free to adjust the URLs and instructions according to your specific project setup and requirements.
